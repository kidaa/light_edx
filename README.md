Course work for MIT 9.01.1x Light, Spike & Sight: The Neuroscience of Vision

==== Motivation

As an architecture student, the importance of light is ever-present. Whether it be understanding what time of the day a room will be well-lit and heated by the sun, or observing the delicate interplay of light and shadow. Vision is certainly the most important, defining sense used in the practice of architecture. As a neuroscience student, I never studied the science of vision, despite it being one the most advanced branch of neuroscience. 

I am taking this class because it offers an opportunity to synthesize my knowledge in two domain, and thereby develop a deeper understanding of the role and meaning of light and vision in human life.
