The eye focuses light using two apparatuses - the cornea and the lens. In humans, the cornea does most of the bending of light (snell's law), while the lens can adjust itself to focus the light perfectly.

In fish, the lens is much stronger (almost spherical), and so performs most of the bending.

* is this right, or is it reversed?

People with nearsightedness have corneas that bend incoming light so much that their lenses are unable to compensate; the light image ends up behind the focal point on the retina.

People with farsightedness have the opposite problem, their corneas bend light so little that their lenses are unable to do the rest of the work. the light focuses in front of the retina in this case.
